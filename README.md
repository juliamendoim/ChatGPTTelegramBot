# ChatGPTTelegramBot
An easy peasy telegram bot in python to chat with ChatGPT

ChatGPT wrote the code, requirements and gitignore files (Also helped with the README).
I've only touched a bit of code to make it run. 

## Usage

To run the bot, you will need to set the `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` and the `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Run

    $ python bot.py
